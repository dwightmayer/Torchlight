# Torchlight
Working with PyTorch

- Going to need to split and reassemble the model from Github
- Next word prediction usually returns special characters, nonsensical prediction
- Once architecture is finalized begin training on the whole corpus
- Iterating through the Dataset and keeping track of it in a notes file </3
- If you don't fight, you can't win!!!
- I should make an experiment log wrapper to monitor training over time
